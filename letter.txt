Subject: Building the Chat Interface with Vercel AI SDK UI Components

Hi Implementation Engineer,

This outlines how to build the frontend chat interface using the Vercel AI SDK UI components, specifically the useChat hook. We'll focus solely on the client-side for now, leaving the backend integration and AI manager logic for a later stage.

1. Installation:

Make sure you have the ai package and the @ai-sdk/react package installed:

pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react
Use code with caution.
Bash
2. Basic Chat Interface with useChat:

Here's the basic structure for a chat component using the useChat hook:

'use client'; // Required for client components in Next.js App Router

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: '/api/ask', // Your backend API endpoint
    keepLastMessageOnError: true, // Ensure UI consistency on errors
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display chat messages */}
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          <p>
            <strong>{m.role}:</strong> {m.content}
          </p>
          {/* Render any UI elements returned by tools */}
            {m.toolInvocations?.map((toolInvocation) => {
              if(toolInvocation.toolName ==="yourToolName"){
                return <YourUIComponent key={toolInvocation.toolCallId} {...toolInvocation.result}  /> 
              }
            })}
        </div>
      ))}

      {/* Input form */}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          placeholder="Type your message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation:

useChat Hook: This hook manages the chat state, handles message sending and receiving, and provides several helper functions.
messages: An array of Message objects, representing the chat history. Each Message has a role ("user" or "assistant") and content. Use m.toolInvocations to access any function/tool calls made by the assistant.
input: The current text entered by the user.
handleInputChange: An event handler for the input field's onChange event. This automatically updates the input state in the hook.
handleSubmit: An event handler for the form's onSubmit event. It appends the user's message to the chat and clears the input field.
3. Backend API Endpoint (/api/ask):

The api prop in useChat points to your backend endpoint. You'll implement this endpoint separately to handle communication with the AI manager and model querying. For now, you can create a placeholder endpoint:

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { StreamingTextResponse, streamText } from 'ai';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai'



export async function POST(req: Request) {
    const { messages } = await req.json()

// do something with these messages e.g. manager duties.
    const stream = OpenAIStream(
      await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        stream: true,
        messages
      })
    )

    return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
}
Use code with caution.

4. Advanced useChat Features (Optional):

isLoading: A boolean indicating if a request is in progress (for loading indicators).
error: Stores any errors encountered during the API call.
stop(): A function to abort the current request.
reload(): A function to regenerate the last AI response.
append(message, options): Can be used for more granular control over message sending and appending, supports additional data, headers, and body.
setData(data): updates the chat data object which is used to store additional data returned by StreamData.
These can be used to enhance the chat interface with loading states, error handling, and other interactive features. You can refer to the useChat documentation for more details and examples.

This setup provides a solid foundation for building your chat interface. Focus on implementing this structure first, and we can address backend integration and AI manager interaction in the next steps.
