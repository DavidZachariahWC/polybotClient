Chat Interface Implementation Overview

1. Vercel AI SDK Usage:
- Using the useChat hook for managing chat state and basic interactions
- Leveraging built-in message handling and streaming capabilities
- Using the SDK's message format and types

2. Custom Implementation:
- Backend API endpoint will be custom-built to work with our manager bot
- Tool invocations will be handled by our own backend logic
- Message routing and delegation will be managed by our backend

3. Component Structure:
- Card-based layout with fixed height
- Scrollable message area
- Input form with send button
- Support for both user and assistant messages
- Prepared for tool-specific UI components

4. Integration Points:
- Frontend: Uses Vercel AI SDK for UI state management
- Backend: Will connect to our custom Python backend instead of direct LLM integration
- Messages: Maintains Vercel AI SDK message format for compatibility

5. Next Steps:
- Implement the /api/chat endpoint
- Add tool-specific UI components
- Connect to the Python backend manager bot
- Add streaming simulation logic
